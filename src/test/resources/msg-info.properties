MSG_BIND=We promise not to record users' account information (user name and password). By default, we will only cache users' authorization information in local. We also provide the account synchronization function which enables you to use third party applications on different devices. If you authorize on one device, the third party account can be logged in immediately on other devices. At this time, we will bind your iAuto account to the third party account. The authorization information will be uploaded to our secure cloud server. We will strictly guarantee the data safety. Of course, you can delete the authorization information saved in the cloud server at any time.\
</br>Do you agree to the binding of your iAuto account and the third party account (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Soundcloud, Foursquare, Feedly, Pocket, Flickr, Vine, 500px)?
